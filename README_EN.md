# Analysis-KG
This repository is built upon the [Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main) model and has realized an interpretable English text knowledge extraction system.

## Introduction
Analysis-KG is a fine-tuned model based on the [Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main) model, which has been developed to create an interpretable English text knowledge extraction system.
The training dataset for fine-tuning is sourced from [Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED).
We have achieved the capability to perform simultaneous analysis and extraction of multiple relations from a sentence. Furthermore, we can extract multiple triple facts corresponding to each relation. For example:
```python
>>>Drossinis Museum is in the center of Kifisia , a northern suburb of Athens , and it is housed in \u201c Amaryllis \u201d villa , where Georgios Drossinis lived in his last years and which is named after a central character of one of his earliest and most popular works . The museum was founded in 1997 with the aim to preserve and promote Drossinis\u2019 ( 1859 - 1951 ) multidimensional work . Drossinis , along with Costis Palamas and Nikos Kampas co - founded the New Athenian School , the Greek literary \u2018 1880s Generation\u2019 , a movement which renewed Greek literature and fought for the establishment of modern Greek language ( \" Demotic \" ) The museum includes three halls , which are on the first floor , while the ground floor houses the Municipal Library of Kifisia , according to Drossinis \u2019s wish .

According to the passage, the relations identified are "country of citizenship," "date of death," "notable work," "date of birth," "place of birth," "location in," and "languages spoken, written or signed." The reasons for these relations are as follows:
1. "Country of citizenship": The passage mentions that the museum is located in Greece, indicating that the country recognizes it as its property.
2. "Date of death": The passage states that Georgios Drossinis lived in the museum for the last 1951, implying that he is no longer alive.
3. "Notable work": The passage mentions that the museum is named after a central character of Drossinis's earliest and most popular works, highlighting its significance.
4. "Date of birth": The passage provides the specific years of Drossinis's birth and death, indicating the time of his birth.
5. "Place of birth": The passage mentions that Drossinis lived in a northern suburb of Athens, indicating that he was born in that specific location.
6. "Location in": The passage states that the museum is located in Kifisia, a suburb of Athens, indicating its association with that specific location.
7. "Languages spoken, written or signed": The passage does not provide evidence to support this relation.
In conclusion, the relations identified are supported by the explicit information provided in the passage, such as the names, dates, and the association of the museum with Drossinis's works and the specific location of Kifisia.

## Usage

### 1.Model train

#### 1) Data prepare
The current knowledge extraction datasets mostly consist of sentences where there's only one relation, and that relation corresponds to one or multiple facts. However, in real-world scenarios, a sentence often contains multiple relations. To obtain well-annotated data with multiple relations, we performed preprocessing on the `train_devised` and `dev_devised` subsets of the [Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED) dataset.
The process is as follows:
##### Clearly Define Relationship Descriptions
There are a total of 96 relationships in the dataset [Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED). However, there are certain issues that need to be addressed:
###### 1.The relationship descriptions are not sufficiently clear
The descriptions for multiple relationships are not sufficiently clear. For instance, in the case of the 'author' relationship, different individuals might interpret it differently. It can be understood as `somebody is the author of somebook` or `somebook is authored by somebody`. Without a clear definition, this ambiguity can lead to confusion between subjects and objects.
###### 2.There is mutual inclusion or contradiction among relations.
For example, the relationships `member of` and `member of political party` could be unified as `member of`. Additionally, relationships like `participant` and `participant of` have opposite semantics; keeping one of them would be sufficient.
In response to the aforementioned issues, we have reorganized and refined the relationships. We have streamlined the total number of relationships to 64 and provided them with clear and unambiguous definitions, ensuring better alignment with the understanding of language models. For specific details, please refer to:
[relation_map.json](https://github.com/bigdante/Analysis_KG/blob/main/data/relations_desc/relation_map.json)
##### 2) analysis process
After preprocessing the foundational data, we employed ChatGPT and human input, utilizing prompt engineering, to generate an analytical process for relationships, subjects, and corresponding facts. To facilitate future endeavors, we have organized the data as follows:
