## 介绍
Analysis-KG 是基于[Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main)模型进行微调，实现了可解释的英文语料知识抽取系统。
微调的训练数据集来源于[Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED)。
我们实现了从句子中，一次性分析抽取多个relations，并且能够抽取出relation对应的多个triple facts，例如：
```python

## 使用方法

### 1.模型训练

#### 1) 数据准备
当前的知识抽取数据集，大多是一个句子中只有一个relation，relation对应1个或者多个的fact。而现实场景中，一个句子其实会包含多个relation。为了得到含有多个relation并且标注良好的语料，我们通过对[Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED)数据的train_devised和dev_devised进行预处理。
具体如下：
##### 清晰定义relation descripiton
[Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED)数据集总共96个关系。但是存在的问题是：
###### 1.relation的description不够清晰
多个relation的表述不够清晰，例如`author`的关系中，不同的人，可能理解不同，可以将此理解为 `somebody is the author of somebook`，也可以理解为`somebook the author is somebody`, 如果没有清晰的定义，则会造成主体和客体混乱。
###### 2.relation互相包含或者相反
例如`member of`和`member of political party`，`member of sports team`其实可以统一为`member of`。
另外例如 `participant`和`participant of`语义相反，保留其中一个即可。

针对以上的问题，我们重新整理改造了relation，梳理出共64个relations，并且赋予了清晰明确的定义，更符合语言模型的理解。具体参见：
[relation_map.json](https://github.com/bigdante/Analysis_KG/blob/main/data/relations_desc/relation_map.json)
##### 2) analysis process
在对基础数据预处理后，我们通过ChatGPT和人工，使用prompt engineering，生成relation、subjects，以及fact的分析过程。并且为了后续的方便，我们将数据整理如下。
