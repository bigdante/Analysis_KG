## 介绍
Analysis-KG 是基于[Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main)模型进行微调，实现了可解释的英文语料知识抽取系统。
微调的训练数据集来源于[Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED)。
我们实现了从句子中，一次性分析抽取多个relations，并且能够抽取出relation对应的多个triple facts，例如：
```python

## 使用方法

### 1.模型训练

#### 1) 数据准备
当前的知识抽取数据集，大多是一个句子中只有一个relation，relation对应1个或者多个的fact。而现实场景中，一个句子其实会包含多个relation。为了得到含有多个relation并且标注良好的语料，我们通过对[Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED)数据的train_devised和dev_devised进行预处理。
具体如下：
##### 清晰定义relation descripiton
[Re-DocRED](https://github.com/tonytan48/Re-DocRED)数据集总共96个关系。但是存在的问题是：
###### 1.relation的description不够清晰
多个relation的表述不够清晰，例如`author`的关系中，不同的人，可能理解不同，可以将此理解为 `somebody is the author of somebook`，也可以理解为`somebook the author is somebody`, 如果没有清晰的定义，则会造成主体和客体混乱。
###### 2.relation互相包含或者相反
例如`member of`和`member of political party`，`member of sports team`其实可以统一为`member of`。
另外例如 `participant`和`participant of`语义相反，保留其中一个即可。

针对以上的问题，我们重新整理改造了relation，梳理出共64个relations，并且赋予了清晰明确的定义，更符合语言模型的理解。具体参见：
[relation_map.json](https://github.com/bigdante/Analysis_KG/blob/main/data/relations_desc/relation_map.json)
##### 2) analysis process
在对基础数据预处理后，我们通过ChatGPT和人工，使用prompt engineering，生成relation、subjects，以及fact的分析过程。并且为了后续的方便，我们将数据整理如下。

## 模型部署
首先载入Tokenizer：

```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# 载入Tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm2-6b", trust_remote_code=True)
```

1. 如果需要加载的 P-Tuning 的 checkpoint：

```python
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm2-6b", trust_remote_code=True, pre_seq_len=128)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm2-6b", config=config, trust_remote_code=True)
prefix_state_dict = torch.load(os.path.join(CHECKPOINT_PATH, "pytorch_model.bin"))
new_prefix_state_dict = {}
for k, v in prefix_state_dict.items():
    if k.startswith("transformer.prefix_encoder."):
        new_prefix_state_dict[k[len("transformer.prefix_encoder."):]] = v
model.transformer.prefix_encoder.load_state_dict(new_prefix_state_dict)
```
注意你可能需要将 `pre_seq_len` 改成你训练时的实际值。如果你是[从本地加载模型](../README.md#从本地加载模型)的话，需要将 `THUDM/chatglm2-6b` 改成本地的模型路径（注意不是checkpoint路径）。

2. 如果需要加载的是全参数微调的 checkpoint，则直接加载整个 checkpoint：

```python
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(CHECKPOINT_PATH, trust_remote_code=True)
```

之后根据需求可以进行量化，也可以直接使用：

```python
# Comment out the following line if you don't use quantization
model = model.quantize(4)
model = model.cuda()
model = model.eval()

response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "你好", history=[])
```

你也可以直接运行支持加载 P-Tuning v2 checkpoint 的 [web demo](./web_demo.py)
```shell
bash web_demo.sh
```
可能需要修改 [web_demo.sh](./web_demo.sh) 的内容以符合你实际的 checkpoint 情况。

## 使用自己的数据集
修改 `train.sh` 和 `evaluate.sh` 中的 `train_file`、`validation_file`和`test_file`为你自己的 JSON 格式数据集路径，并将 `prompt_column` 和 `response_column` 改为 JSON 文件中输入文本和输出文本对应的 KEY。可能还需要增大 `max_source_length` 和 `max_target_length` 来匹配你自己的数据集中的最大输入输出长度。

## 对话数据集

如需要使用多轮对话数据对模型进行微调，可以提供聊天历史，例如以下是一个三轮对话的训练数据：

```json lines
{"prompt": "长城h3风扇不转。继电器好的。保险丝好的传感器新的风扇也新的这是为什么。就是继电器缺一个信号线", "response": "用电脑能读数据流吗？水温多少", "history": []}
{"prompt": "95", "response": "上下水管温差怎么样啊？空气是不是都排干净了呢？", "history": [["长城h3风扇不转。继电器好的。保险丝好的传感器新的风扇也新的这是为什么。就是继电器缺一个信号线", "用电脑能读数据流吗？水温多少"]]}
{"prompt": "是的。上下水管都好的", "response": "那就要检查线路了，一般风扇继电器是由电脑控制吸合的，如果电路存在断路，或者电脑坏了的话会出现继电器不吸合的情况！", "history": [["长城h3风扇不转。继电器好的。保险丝好的传感器新的风扇也新的这是为什么。就是继电器缺一个信号线", "用电脑能读数据流吗？水温多少"], ["95", "上下水管温差怎么样啊？空气是不是都排干净了呢？"]]}
```

训练时需要指定 `--history_column` 为数据中聊天历史的 key（在此例子中是 `history`），将自动把聊天历史拼接。要注意超过输入长度 `max_source_length` 的内容会被截断。

可以参考以下指令：

```shell
bash train_chat.sh
```
